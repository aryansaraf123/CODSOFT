# CODSOFT
## Overview
This repository showcases three amazing tasks that I developed during my one-month internship at Codsoft as a Data Science Intern. In this time, I created three significant tasks that demonstrate my skills in data manipulation and visualization using various Python libraries.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.

## Jupyter Notebooks
The repository contains Jupyter notebooks for the following tasks completed during my internship:

1. [Task 1 - Titanic Disaster Analysis](https://github.com/aryansaraf123/CODSOFT/blob/main/Titanic%20Disaster%20Analysis%20-%20Task%201.ipynb):
   - Have used the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.
   - This dataset contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class,  fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

2. [Task 2 - IMDB Indian movies analysis](https://github.com/aryansaraf123/CODSOFT/blob/main/IMDB%20Indian%20movies%20analysis%20-%20Task%202.ipynb):
   - Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. Have used the regression techniques to tackle this problem.
   - Analyzed the historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.

3. [Task 3 - Advertising/Sales Prediction](https://github.com/aryansaraf123/CODSOFT/blob/main/Advertising%20-%20Task%203.ipynb):
   - This task involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.
